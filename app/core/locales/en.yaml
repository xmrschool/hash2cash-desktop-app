BENCHMARK_HEADER: To start, we need to clarify some things
BENCHMARK_FIRST: |
  Some antiviruses are taking our app as a virus. And the reason for this
  is apps which mine cryptocurrency without a user's contest. Hash to
  cash â€“ is not a virus. Antivirus can't detect if a user gives
  permission, so it just bans every miner.
BENCHMARK_SECOND: |
  If your antivirus made a mistake, add the Hash to Cash app folder to
  antivirus exception list.
BENCHMARK_THIRD: |
  We need about 5 minutes to download miner binaries and do benchmark
  test. Hang on!
BENCHMARK_GO: Ok, start

DRIVER_ISSUE_ABOUT: |
  We can't detect which OpenCL (AMD) devices you're using. Hash to Cash may fall because of old GPU driver. You can switch to another detection method (which is not so precise as original), but it should work everywhere.
