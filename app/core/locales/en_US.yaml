  BENCHMARK_HEADER: To start, we need to clarify some things
  BENCHMARK_FIRST: |
    Some antiviruses are taking our app as virus. And the reason for this
              is apps which mine cryptocurrency without a user's contest. Hash to
              cash â€“ is not a virus. Antivirus can't detect if a user gives
              permission, so it just bans every miner.
  BENCHMARK_SECOND: |
    If your antivirus made a mistake, add the Hash to Cash app folder to
              antivirus exception list.
  BENCHMARK_THIRD: |
    We need about 5 minutes to download miner binaries and do benchmark
              test. Please, be patient

  BENCHMARK_GO: Ok, start
